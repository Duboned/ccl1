## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** Comming up with style of game that I wanted to execute went really well because I had clear idea.
- **Core Mechanics:** Shooting, moving and taking damage mechanics were not as hard as I thought.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Making working game under such time constraints while having final exams and projects is very diffcult.
- **Accessibilty:** Coding with visual imparement while learning proved to be extreme challange.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Time allocation matters:** Spending too much time on one thing can hinder the progress.
- **Intial design is everything:** Chaning important design elements on the fly can introduce deep rooted issues.
